            Dubai Creek, Marina, and Canal each offer unique and distinct cruising experiences. Cruising around the Historic fish harbor in Creek, watching the luminous Skyscrapers in Marina, and experiencing the attractiveness of Downtown while on-boarding on the water canal cruise can give you a separate flavor of entertainment. We can’t precisely rate or compare any one of these cruises due to the unique vibe of each service.
